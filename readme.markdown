# snob

snob is a version control system written in js. consider it a a minimial port of git.
one of the best uses is to learn you exactly how git works. 

the core component of snob is [adiff](http://github.com/dominictarr/adiff) see `adiff`'s readme for a detailed explaination of diff, patch, and 3-way-merge.

## what next?

 - still thinking about how I will manage diffs on objects,

 - add push and pull via local files and with an http server.
