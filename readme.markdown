Snob is a Version Control System implemented is js. 
you can think of it as a Model layer for realtime collaborative applications,
or as a peer to peer database.

Snob has the same architecture as git, but with plugable diff tools. That means,
it can support any kind of objects, if you can `diff`, `diff3`, and `patch` them.

currently ALPHA, but progressing rapidly.
