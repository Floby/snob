# snob

Snob is an experimental Version Control System implemented is js. 

You can think of it as a Model layer for realtime collaborative applications,
or as a peer to peer database.

Snob has the same architecture as `git`, but with plugable diff-tools. That means,
it can support any kind of objects, if you can `diff`, `diff3`, and `patch` them.

currently experimental, please contact if you are interested in using this.
